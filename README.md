**Free, Open-Source Emailing System for Blind**

## About
   The project is a `python-based` application for visually impaired persons using speech to text voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform all the other useful tasks. The system will prompt the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same. The main benefit of this system is that the use of mouse is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice only.
   
## Features
* Send email via voice.
* Fetch unseen emails.
* Count number of unseen emails.

## Modification
 * If you want to save the mp3 files in other directory then just follow the below instruction otherwise don't modify anything. 
 * Just add your desktop directory in code where I have used `path` words in several lines. If you don't know your desktop directory then just open `terminal` or `command prompt` and paste the below code. Like: `C:\Users\manya\Desktop` (this is my desktop directory).
 
   ```%userprofile%\Desktop```
   
 * Also paste your `email id` and `password` in line number 104.
 * If `invalid or unsupported audio file` occurs or `Recall that only FLAC, AIFF, and RIFF WAV files are supported` occurs then try this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25672289/failed-to-open-file-file-wav-as-a-wav-due-to-file-does-not-start-with-riff-id/57349558#57349558). Read the file with `librosa`, then convert it back to a temporary `.wav` file. Then read it back with the `wave` package.
 * Okay so for SMTPAuthenticationError just visit this [site](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). Allow the less secure  apps: ON

 * So install `avbin`. I have provided two types of avbin. Just install one of them according your architecture.
 * If your system needs this then just uncomment line number 13 & 14 in the code.
 * For more info have a look on this [AVbin](https://github.com/AVbin/AVbin)
